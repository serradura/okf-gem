# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-12

- Graph server UX round. Selecting a node now makes one camera move instead of
  two (the pan used to race the opening panel and the debounced canvas resize,
  a dizzying double movement; rapid clicks also queued animations — both fixed).
  Relative markdown links inside the inspector and the files preview resolve
  against the open concept and navigate in-app — clicking `../model/graph.md`
  selects that concept instead of 404ing the page; external links open in a new
  tab; links that leave the bundle are disabled, never a 404. Nodes are smaller
  (14–44px, was 24–70) and layouts keep a real gap between them (`nodeOverlap`
  for cose, `avoidOverlap`/`spacingFactor` elsewhere). The inspector and the
  files list are drag-resizable (persisted, double-click resets), and the files
  reader now uses the full pane width. New file-tree mode on the graph toolbar:
  folders become nodes and the only edges are folder→child, an acyclic layered
  tree of the bundle's files. On small screens (≤900px) the inspector starts
  hidden and opens on the first node tap; camera moves are gentler (450ms,
  ease-in-out).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-12

- The graph server page now emits link-preview metadata: Open Graph and Twitter
  Card tags with a social image, plus `theme-color` and `color-scheme`, so a
  shared `okf server` URL unfurls as a proper card in chat and social apps.
- Docs: a themed README hero (light and dark), a GitHub social preview image,
  and Website / Live demo / Claude Code plugin links.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

- Claude Code plugin. The repository now doubles as a plugin marketplace:
  `/plugin marketplace add serradura/okf-gem`, then `/plugin install okf@okfgem`.
  The plugin carries the canonical skill (a generated copy; `rake plugin:sync`
  keeps it in lockstep with `lib/okf/skill`, and a test fails on drift), one
  front-door command (`/okf:gem`: no arguments orients on the CLI, the bundle,
  and what `validate`/`lint` report and recommends the highest-value next move
  without running one, `doctor` installs the gem and doctors the repo's bundle,
  `curate` runs the full validate + lint + loose cycle, anything else hands the
  task to the skill), and a PostToolUse hook that runs `okf validate` +
  `okf lint` after every edit inside a bundle and hands the relevant findings
  back as context: every conformance error, plus the warnings and lint findings
  that concern the edited file. The checks are the CLI's own, so the feedback is
  deterministic. The hook stays silent outside bundles, and when the CLI is
  missing it suggests `/okf:gem` once per session instead of erroring on each
  edit. It is config-free to silence: `OKF_CURATE_DISABLED=1` turns it off,
  `OKF_CURATE_QUIET=1` keeps the findings but drops that suggestion, and an
  `<!-- okf-disable -->` comment in a file skips curation for that one. The skill
  routes through per-verb playbooks (`playbooks/`), and its signature guidance
  lines carry stable `<!-- check:… -->` / `<!-- rule:okf-… -->` markers.
  Nothing under `plugin/` ships in the gem.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

- The graph server now sanitizes every concept body before rendering it. The
  page runs marked's HTML output through [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
  (loaded from the same CDN as Cytoscape and marked) on the way to the DOM, so a
  bundle carrying active content in a Markdown body can no longer script the
  viewer. Inlined graph data was already escaped through `json_for_script`; this
  closes the other path.
- `require "okf"` now loads the pure library only. The two argv-facing shells —
  `OKF::CLI` and the `OKF::Skill` installer — load on demand, from `exe/okf` or
  an explicit `require "okf/cli"` / `require "okf/skill"`. `optparse` moves with
  the CLI, so an embedding app (e.g. a Rails store) that only reaches for the
  in-memory model and on-disk handles no longer pulls in the command-line
  machinery. The CLI itself is unchanged.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

Initial release.

- `OKF::Concept` / `OKF::Bundle`: pure in-memory model of an OKF v0.1 bundle,
  buildable straight from data (no disk) with link, citation, and markdown
  round-trip primitives.
- `OKF::Bundle::Validator`: the spec §9 conformance gate (hard errors) with the
  spec's soft guidance reported as warnings — broken cross-links are tolerated,
  as §5.3 requires.
- `OKF::Bundle::Linter`: advisory curation-quality report across reachability,
  backlog, completeness, freshness, provenance, and hygiene, with `--json` as a
  machine substrate.
- `OKF::Bundle::Graph`: the knowledge graph (nodes, edges, type/tag indexes) at
  selectable fidelity.
- On-disk handles: `OKF::Bundle::Folder`, `OKF::Bundle::Reader`,
  `OKF::Bundle::Writer` (atomic, validate-before-publish), and
  `OKF::Concept::File`.
- `OKF::Server::App`: the interactive graph as a mountable Rack app — five views
  (graph, catalog, files, tags, stats) with type/area/tag filtering throughout,
  bodies fetched live from disk — served by a built-in WEBrick runner
  (`okf server`).
- `okf` CLI: `validate`, `lint`, `loose`, and `graph`, plus the read views as
  text — `index`, `catalog`, `files`, `tags`, `types`, `stats` — at full parity
  with the browser: every list view narrows with `--type`/`--area`/`--tag`
  (case-insensitive; the bundle root is area `(root)`, accepted as `root`), and
  `tags --by type|area` regroups the tag index per concept dimension with
  within-group counts — the tag-curation view. `server` boots the graph page;
  `skill` installs the companion skill.
- `okf index`: a read view over the progressive-disclosure layer (spec §6) — one
  entry per directory that holds concepts or carries an `index.md`, root first,
  with its authored index body (frontmatter stripped), a type/tag rollup over the
  concepts that live there, its child directories, and the concept listing. A
  directory with concepts but no `index.md` has its listing synthesized (§6 permits
  it) and is flagged. `--area` (repeatable), `--no-body`, and `--json`; advisory,
  always exit 0. Backed by the pure `OKF::Bundle#directory_index`.
- JSON output is **compact by default** across every emitting verb (the
  token-efficient machine substrate, matching the server); `--pretty` indents it
  for reading and implies `--json`. JSON semantics are identical either way — only
  whitespace differs — so any parser is unaffected.
- JSON property projection on the list views: `index`, `catalog`, and `files`
  take `--fields a,b` (emit only these properties) or `--except a,b` (emit all but
  these), so an agent never pays tokens for fields it will not read. The flags are
  mutually exclusive, imply `--json`, match property names case-insensitively, and
  reject an unknown name (exit 2) listing the valid ones; `okf index --no-body` is
  shorthand for dropping the `body` field.
- Bundled companion agent skill (`okf skill <dest>`): SKILL.md carrying the
  judgment (the CLI surface stays self-describing via `--help`) — including the
  orient-before-you-read protocol and the CLI/judgment boundary — the OKF v0.1
  spec, authoring and CLI references (tag-vocabulary curation, the SPEC-section
  map, the closeout gate), and concept/index/log templates.
- Runs on Ruby >= 2.4 with two runtime dependencies: rack and webrick.
